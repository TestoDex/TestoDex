# Admin Panel Guide

The TestoDex admin panel gives you full control over pools, rewards, and platform content. Hereâ€™s how to flex your admin powers:

## 1. Pool Management
- **Add Pool:** Choose stake token, reward token, APR, and pool fee. Click 'Add Pool'.
- **Edit Pool:** Update APR, fee, or status (active/inactive) for any pool.
- **Remove Pool:** Deactivate a pool to stop new staking.

## 2. Fee Settings
- Set a fee (in basis points, e.g., 100 = 1%) for each staking pool.
- All fees are sent to the Testodex Treasury contract.
- Only the owner can withdraw from the Treasury.

## 3. Token Minting
- Mint new TESTO or TSonic tokens directly from the admin panel.
- Only the contract owner can mint.

## 4. Content Management
- Add or edit jokes, images, and themed content for the platform.
- Keep the UI fun and engaging!

## 5. Stats Dashboard
- View user, pool, and platform statistics in real time.
